[h3] To Note [/h3]
This mod is [u] not intended[/u] for less experienced players. You may end up collapsing into The Warlord Era, however whilst this will be challenging, it is recoverable.
Winning (cheesing) the Opium War will result in a trivially easy campaign. It is not intended to be won. Setting AI aggression to "High" is strongly recommended.


Anyone welcome to use part/all of this mod in their own, and if so credit with a reference appreciated.
